<li>One Piece was first published in Weekly Shonen Jump in August, 1997. The manga was based on one-shots published under the title Romance Dawn the previous year. Because of the series’ popularity, publisher Shueisha began to collect the weekly chapters into tankobon in December, 1997. Creator Eiichiro Oda initially intended to end the series in 2001, but both the popularity of the series and Oda’s enjoyment in writing it have compelled him to continue indefinitely.</li>

<li>The manga has also been sold in collected volumes in North America, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The translations of the manga from Japanese into English preserve the manga panel layout, which reads from right to left, in order to preserve the integrity of the connected scenes. The manga’s humor often revolves around puns and jokes involving misheard statements, so translators often change the phrasing to preserve the humor rather than follow the most literal interpretation.</li>

<li>a child, Monkey D. Luffy idolizes a group of pirates resting at his hometown and decides to become a pirate. He accidently eats a cursed fruit and gains rubber powers. At fifteen, he sets out in a small ship to find One Piece, the treasure of the Pirate King. Luffy quickly finds a swordsman, Zolo; a navigator, Nami; a sharpshooter, Usopp; and a chef, Sanji, and establishes the Straw Hat crew. Nami is trapped in a deal with a brutal fishman pirate named Arlong. The Straw Hat crew follows Nami to her hometown and defeats Arlong and his crew.
